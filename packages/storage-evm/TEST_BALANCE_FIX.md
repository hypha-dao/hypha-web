# Energy Simulation Test - Distribution/Consumption Balance Fix

## ✅ Fixed: Distribution and Consumption Now Match Exactly

### Before (Unbalanced)

```
📊 Energy Distribution:
   Solar: 200 kWh
   Battery Charge: -80 kWh
   ─────────────────────
   Net to Households: 120 kWh

   H1 (30%): 36 kWh
   H2 (25%): 30 kWh
   H3 (20%): 24 kWh
   H4 (15%): 18 kWh
   H5 (10%): 12 kWh

💡 Energy Consumption:
   H1: 25 kWh ❌ (11 kWh remaining)
   H2: 20 kWh ❌ (10 kWh remaining)
   H3: 15 kWh ❌ ( 9 kWh remaining)
   H4: 10 kWh ❌ ( 8 kWh remaining)
   H5:  8 kWh ❌ ( 4 kWh remaining)
   ─────────────────────
   Total: 78 kWh

🚨 PROBLEM: 42 kWh left unconsumed!
   - Blocks next distribution
   - Test cannot run continuously
```

### After (Balanced) ✅

```
📊 Energy Distribution:
   Solar: 200 kWh
   Battery Charge: -80 kWh
   ─────────────────────
   Net to Households: 120 kWh

   H1 (30%): 36 kWh
   H2 (25%): 30 kWh
   H3 (20%): 24 kWh
   H4 (15%): 18 kWh
   H5 (10%): 12 kWh

💡 Energy Consumption:
   H1: 36 kWh ✅ (100% self-consumption)
   H2: 30 kWh ✅ (100% self-consumption)
   H3: 24 kWh ✅ (100% self-consumption)
   H4: 18 kWh ✅ (100% self-consumption)
   H5: 12 kWh ✅ (100% self-consumption)
   ─────────────────────
   Total: 120 kWh

✅ PERFECT: All energy consumed!
   - Zero remaining in pool
   - Next distribution allowed
   - Test can run continuously
   - Perfect zero-sum accounting
```

## Accounting Impact

### Community Balance (Self-Consumption Payments)

Each household pays for their own energy at 0.10 USDC/kWh:

```
H1: 36 kWh × 0.10 = 3.60 USDC (3,600,000 raw)
H2: 30 kWh × 0.10 = 3.00 USDC (3,000,000 raw)
H3: 24 kWh × 0.10 = 2.40 USDC (2,400,000 raw)
H4: 18 kWh × 0.10 = 1.80 USDC (1,800,000 raw)
H5: 12 kWh × 0.10 = 1.20 USDC (1,200,000 raw)
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Community receives: 12.00 USDC (12,000,000 raw) ✅
```

### Zero-Sum Verification

```
Household Balances:
  H1: -3,600,000
  H2: -3,000,000
  H3: -2,400,000
  H4: -1,800,000
  H5: -1,200,000
  Sum: -12,000,000

Community Balance: +12,000,000

Export Balance:      0
Import Balance:      0
Settled Balance:     0

─────────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL: 0 ✅ (Perfect zero-sum!)
```

## Benefits of 100% Self-Consumption Test

1. **Simplicity**: No peer-to-peer trading complexity
2. **Predictability**: Easy to verify expected balances
3. **Zero-Sum**: Perfect accounting with only Member ↔ Community flows
4. **Repeatability**: Can run multiple cycles without manual resets
5. **Realism**: Tests the most common scenario (households consuming their own solar)

## Testing

Run the updated test:

```bash
cd packages/storage-evm/scripts/base-mainnet-contracts-scripts
ts-node emergency-reset.ts  # Clear old state
ts-node energy-simulation.ts  # Run balanced test
```

Expected output:

- ✅ Distribution: 120 kWh
- ✅ Consumption: 120 kWh
- ✅ Remaining: 0 kWh
- ✅ Community Balance: 12,000,000
- ✅ Total System Balance: 0
- ✅ Ready for next cycle!
