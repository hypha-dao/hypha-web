# Epics for hypha platform

This folder contains the epics for the hypha platform, which is designed to accelerate collaboration and innovation within the regenerative economy. Each epic represents a major feature or functionality that supports the platform's mission of enabling regenerative organisations to coordinate.

## Current Epics

- [Profile](./src/profile/README.md)
- [Governance](./src/governance/README.md)

## Epic Development Guidelines

1. Each epic should be created and described as a separate folder in `packages/epics/<epic-name>/README.md`
2. Include clear user stories that define the main goals of the epic.
3. Provide a detailed functionality overview, breaking down the epic into smaller, manageable features.
4. Consider implementation details and integration with other platform components.
5. Outline next steps for development and any dependencies on other epics or features.

## Best Practices

- Ensure that each epic aligns with the platform's goal of fostering collaboration in the regenerative economy.
- Follow clean code principles and the development workflow outlined in the main INSTRUCTIONS.md file.
- Use consistent naming conventions and structure across all epic documentation.
- Regularly update this README.md file as new epics are added or existing ones are modified.
- Incorporate user feedback and iterate on user stories to better reflect the needs of the platform's users.
- Focus on creating a seamless experience that accelerates collaboration and innovation within the regenerative economy ecosystem.
