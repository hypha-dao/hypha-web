# Governance Epic

The Governance epic focuses on enabling decentralized teams to create, discuss, and vote on proposals within the hypha platform. This feature is crucial for coordinating regenerative organizations and facilitating collaborative decision-making processes.

## User Stories

1. As a member of a regenerative organization, I want to create draft proposals so that I can prepare and refine my ideas before sharing them with others.
2. As a proposal creator, I want to transition my draft proposal to a discussion state so that I can gather feedback and input from other members.
3. As a member, I want to participate in discussions about proposed ideas so that I can contribute to the decision-making process.
4. As a proposal creator, I want to move my proposal to a voting state so that members can make decisions on the proposed changes.
5. As a member, I want to vote on proposals (yes/no) so that I can have a say in the organization's decisions.
6. As a member, I want to view the results of proposal votes so that I can understand the collective decisions of the organization.

## Functionality Overview

### 1. Proposal Creation
- Members can create draft proposals with a title, description, and any relevant attachments.
- Draft proposals are private and only visible to the creator.

### 2. Proposal States
- Draft: Initial state, private to the creator.
- Discussion: Open for member feedback and input.
- Voting: Committed to the blockchain for member voting.

### 3. State Transitions
- Draft to Discussion: Creator can open the proposal for member input.
- Discussion to Voting: Creator can move the proposal to a voting state.

### 4. Discussion Functionality
- Members can comment on proposals in the discussion state.
- Threaded comments for organized conversations.

### 5. Voting Mechanism
- Proposals in the voting state are committed to the blockchain.
- Members can cast votes (yes/no) on active proposals.
- Vote tracking and result calculation.

### 6. Proposal Management
- List view of all proposals with filtering options (by state, date, etc.).
- Detailed view of individual proposals with their current state and history.

## Implementation Considerations

1. Implement a secure authentication system to ensure only authorized members can create and interact with proposals.
2. Design a scalable database structure to store proposal data, comments, and votes.
3. Develop a blockchain integration for committing proposals and recording votes.
4. Create a user-friendly interface for proposal creation, discussion, and voting.
5. Implement real-time updates for proposal states and discussions.

## Next Steps

1. Design the data model for proposals, including all necessary fields and state information.
2. Create wireframes and mockups for the proposal creation, discussion, and voting interfaces.
3. Implement the backend API for proposal CRUD operations and state management.
4. Develop the frontend components for proposal creation and management.
5. Integrate the blockchain functionality for proposal commitment and vote recording.
6. Implement the discussion and commenting system.
7. Create the voting interface and result calculation mechanism.
8. Conduct thorough testing of all governance features and user flows.
9. Gather user feedback and iterate on the implementation as needed.

## Dependencies

- User authentication and authorization system
- Blockchain integration for proposal commitment and vote recording
- Real-time update functionality for collaborative features

This Governance epic is essential for enabling effective decision-making within regenerative organizations using the hypha platform. It will provide a structured approach to proposal creation, discussion, and voting, fostering collaboration and transparency in the governance process.
