# OlympusDAO v2 Bonds

## Overview

OlympusDAO v2 bonds represent an innovative mechanism for protocol-controlled token distribution and treasury management. The system allows users to purchase protocol tokens (OHM) at a discount by providing various assets, creating a win-win situation for both users and the protocol.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Dynamic Pricing Mechanism

- Uses a linear decay function for bond prices
- Prices adjust based on market conditions and demand
- More predictable than exponential decay models
- Helps maintain price stability while ensuring market efficiency

### 2. Fixed Expiry Markets

Bond markets operate with fixed expiration dates, where:

- All bonds in a market expire simultaneously
- Creates clear market cycles
- Allows for coordinated treasury management
- Simplifies user understanding and decision-making

### 3. Instant Claims

Modern approach to bond distribution:

- Immediate token access upon purchase
- No vesting periods
- Reduces complexity in user experience
- Maintains capital efficiency

### 4. Multiple Market Support

Flexible market structure allowing:

- Various input tokens (stablecoins, LP tokens, etc.)
- Different parameters per market
- Strategic treasury diversification
- Targeted liquidity acquisition
