# NEAR Protocol

## Overview

NEAR Protocol is a layer-1 blockchain designed for usability and scalability. It introduces innovative concepts like account abstraction, named accounts, and function-call keys that create a more user-friendly blockchain experience while maintaining security and decentralization.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Account System

Modern approach to blockchain accounts:

- Human-readable named accounts (e.g., `alice.near`)
- Domain-like hierarchy for sub-accounts
- Multiple access keys per account
- Implicit addresses for programmatic use

### 2. Access Keys

Flexible permission system allowing:

- Full-Access Keys for complete account control
- Function-Call Keys for limited contract interactions
- Allowance-based gas consumption
- Contract-specific permissions

### 3. Chain Abstraction

Advanced user experience features:

- Email-based account creation (FastAuth)
- Meta-transactions for gasless operations
- Cross-chain signatures
- Account recovery mechanisms

### 4. Transaction Model

Efficient transaction processing:

- Action-based transaction structure
- Predictable gas costs
- Multiple operations per transaction
- Atomic execution guarantees
