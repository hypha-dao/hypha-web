## Overview

- Introduction to Hypha's token ecosystem
- Token utility and purpose
- Key token characteristics

## System Architecture

<Bleed>![System Architecture](./tokenomics-system-architecture.png)</Bleed>

### Core Actors

- **Members (M)**: Individual participants in the ecosystem
- **Organizations (O)**: Organizational entities that can use platform features
- **Features (F)**: Platform functionalities and services

### Governance Structure

1. **Functional Governance**

   - Parameter management system
   - Profit margin split configurations
   - Change request mechanisms
   - Parameter proposal system

2. **Roadmap Governance**
   - Feature prioritization
   - Backlog management
   - Grant bidding system
   - Milestone delivery tracking

### Operational Components

- **HYPHA Treasury**: Central value management system
- **Service DAOs**: Specialized service delivery organizations
- **Milestone System**: Deliverable tracking and approval mechanism
- **Value Streams**: Revenue flow from features to treasury
- **Grant Allocation**: System for distributing resources to service providers
