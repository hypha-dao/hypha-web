# MVP: Single Token Create DAO Flow

![static badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/STATUS-DRAFT-orange)

## Overview

This document describes the flow for creating a DAO using our single token system. The process involves creating an initial balance via our Treasury Smart Contract.

## Technical Implementation

One smart contract manages all spaces and tracks their respective balances.

    participant U as User
    participant H as Hypha V3
    participant T as Treasury
    participant SC as SwapContract

    U->>H: Opens Platform
    activate H

    H->>H: check auth
    H->>U: go to platform
    deactivate H

    U->>H: Create DAO
    activate H

    H->>T: Register DAO
    activate T
    T->>T: Create Balance Entry in the ledger
    T->>H: Success
    deactivate T
    H->>T: Pay creation fee
    activate T
    T->>SC: Swap USDC to Hypha
    activate SC
    SC->>T: Swapped HyphaToken to Treasury
    deactivate SC
    T->>H: Payment Success
    deactivate T
    H->>H: Create DAO
    H->>U: DAO Created
    deactivate H
```

## Token Utility

### Why do we need a Token?

1. Raise funds for platform development and maintenance
2. Enable community governance and decision-making
3. Create aligned incentives between platform and users
4. Facilitate value capture from platform usage
5. Enable future ecosystem expansion and integrations

### Token Economics

- Fixed supply: [Supply amount]
- Initial distribution: [Distribution details]
- Vesting schedules: [Vesting details]
- Treasury allocation: [Allocation details]

## Security Considerations

- Smart contract auditing
- Rate limiting for token swaps
- Treasury multi-sig requirements
- Governance timelock mechanisms
