# Tokenomics

## TreehaToken (TREH)

The TreehaToken is a stable coin specifically designed for the Hypha Network ecosystem. Its name is inspired by Trehalose, the crucial molecule that enables nutrient exchange in mycelial networks - nature's own resource-sharing system. Just as mycelial networks (also known as the "Wood Wide Web") allow forests to share resources and thrive, TreehaToken serves as the fundamental resource that enables DAOs to grow and flourish within the Hypha ecosystem.

### Purpose

- Provides a stable, local currency for platform usage payments
- Enables predictable and sustainable economic interactions within the network
- Powers the platform's subscription and service fees
- Mirrors nature's efficient resource distribution systems

### How it Works

- Users receive TreehaTokens when joining the ecosystem
- Tokens are used to pay for platform services and DAO creation
- Each payment facilitates resource exchange within the network, similar to how mycelial networks distribute nutrients in nature
- The stable value ensures transparent and predictable operational costs

This biomimetic tokenomics model creates a sustainable cycle where platform usage directly contributes to ecosystem growth and stability, much like the interconnected root systems of a thriving forest.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### How is TreehaToken's stability ensured?

TreehaToken implements a unique "Compute-Power Peg" mechanism that ties its value to real-world computing costs. Unlike traditional stablecoins that are pegged to fiat currencies or backed by crypto assets, TreehaToken's value is determined by the actual operational costs of running the Hypha Network infrastructure.

Key aspects of the stability mechanism:

- The token's value is derived from global infrastructure deployment costs
- Real-time computation of price-per-compute-unit across our global infrastructure
- Automatic adjustment based on infrastructure provider pricing (AWS, GCP, etc.)
- Natural hedge against global inflation as it reflects real-world computing costs

This approach ensures that users always receive predictable and fair pricing for platform usage, regardless of global economic conditions or regional cost variations.

### What makes TreehaToken different from other stablecoins?

- **Infrastructure-Backed**: Value is backed by actual computing resources rather than fiat or crypto assets
- **Utility-Driven**: Designed specifically for platform service payments
- **Inflation-Resistant**: Naturally adjusts to global changes in computing costs
- **Ecosystem-Aligned**: Value mechanism directly supports the platform's operational sustainability

### How are new TreehaTokens minted?

TreehaTokens are minted through two primary mechanisms:

1. Initial distribution as rewards for ecosystem participation
2. On-demand minting based on platform usage requirements

The minting rate is governed by:

- Actual platform computing resource usage
- Network growth metrics
- Treasury reserve requirements

### Can TreehaTokens be traded externally?

While TreehaTokens can be transferred between users within the Hypha ecosystem, they are primarily designed as a utility token for platform services. Their value is optimized for internal ecosystem operations rather than external trading.

### What happens to spent TreehaTokens?

Spent TreehaTokens flow back to the Treasury, where they are:

1. Redistributed as rewards for ecosystem participation
2. Used to maintain platform infrastructure
3. Held in reserve to ensure system stability

This creates a closed-loop system that maintains token velocity while ensuring sustainable ecosystem growth.
