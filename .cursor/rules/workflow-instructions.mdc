# Coding workflow preferences

- Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task
- Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task
- Write thorough tests for all major functionality
- Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how a feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicitly instructed
- Always think about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes
- NEVER create migrations manually - the folder `./src/migrations` is managed by `payload` directly
- After creating or modifying collections, run `npx payload generate:db-schema` to update the database schema
- After generating the db-schema, run `npx payload migrate:create` to generate the migration files
- Document all significant changes and decisions in the journal system
- Follow the ontology-based structure for content modeling when adding new concepts or relationships
