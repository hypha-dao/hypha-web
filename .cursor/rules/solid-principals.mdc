# Follow SOLID principles

Applying SOLID principles to Next.js development can significantly improve maintainability and scalability7:

- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Create focused components and pages.
- Open-Closed Principle (OCP): Use abstractions to promote extensibility.
- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Ensure interchangeability of derived and base components.
- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Design specific and client-focused interfaces.
- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): Implement dependency injection for better modularity and testability.
